## ISSUES & BUGS :
Please use the system provided on Github "Issues" tab by opening a new issue, **don't forget to choice which mod is concerned and fill with all related informations**.
**Any ticket not related to a bug and/or incomplete will not be answered**.

We do not provide official support anymore, that is to say all the questions about the __installation__ and __the use of our mods on the server side__, you just have to read our documentations to have the adequate information. **However, our members on discord can probably help you**.

For questions related to gameplay, i.e. the use of our mods by a player, you can consult our documentations or ask questions on our discord.
